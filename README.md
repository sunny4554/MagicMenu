## Installation and usage

> [!WARNING]
> Before installing Elysium Mod Menu, make sure you understand the disclaimer and use the menu only in private, testing, or consenting lobbies.

###  1. Install BepInEx IL2CPP
 
 ♯ Elysium Mod Menu is a **BepInEx IL2CPP** mod.
Among Us is a Unity IL2CPP game, so the normal Mono version of BepInEx will not work.

 ♯ Download BepInEx IL2CPP from one of these sources:

* [BepInEx releases](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
* [BepInEx bleeding-edge builds](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)

 ♯ Choose the archive that matches your Among Us build:

| Game version source     | Recommended BepInEx architecture |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| Steam                   | x86                              |
| Itch.io                 | x86                              |
| Epic Games              | x64                              |
| Microsoft Store         | x64                              |
| Xbox App / PC Game Pass | x64                              |

If you are not sure which architecture your game uses, open Among Us, then open **Task Manager**.
If the process is shown as `Among Us.exe (32-bit)`, use **x86**. Otherwise, use **x64**.

### 2. Place BepInEx into the Among Us folder

ඩ Open your Among Us installation folder. It should contain files like:

```
Among Us.exe
GameAssembly.dll
```

♯ Extract the BepInEx archive directly into this folder.

♯ After extracting, your Among Us folder should look similar to this:

```
Among Us/
├─ Among Us.exe
├─ GameAssembly.dll
├─ winhttp.dll
├─ dotnet/
└─ BepInEx/
```

If you do not see `winhttp.dll`, `dotnet`, and `BepInEx` next to `Among Us.exe`, the archive was probably extracted into an extra folder. Open that folder and move its contents directly into the Among Us directory.

Launch Among Us once after installing BepInEx.
The first launch may take longer than usual and a console window may appear. This is normal. Once the game reaches the main menu, close it.

### 3. Install Elysium Mod Menu

Download `ElysiumModMenu.dll` from the [latest Elysium release](https://github.com/meowchelo/ElysiumModMenu/releases/latest).

Place the file here:

```
Among Us/BepInEx/plugins/ElysiumModMenu.dll
```

If the `plugins` folder does not exist, create it manually inside the `BepInEx` folder.

### 4. Launch and open the menu

 ♡ Start Among Us.

Press **Insert** to open Elysium Mod Menu.
On some keyboards, you may need to press **Fn + Insert** or enable/disable **Num Lock**.

The menu key can be changed later in the menu settings.

### Updating ☾ Elysium Mod Menu

To update the menu:

1. ♯ Close Among Us.

2. ♯ Download the new `ElysiumModMenu.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/meowchelo/ElysiumModMenu/releases/latest).

3. ♯ Replace the old file in:

   ```
   Among Us/BepInEx/plugins/
   ```

4. ♡ Start the game again.

## Supported platforms

| Platform                    | Status                                                |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Steam**                   | Supported                                             |
| **Itch.io**                 | Supported                                             |
| **Epic Games**              | Supported                                             |
| **Microsoft Store**         | Supported                                             |
| **Xbox App / PC Game Pass** | Supported                                             |
| Cracked / unofficial builds | May work inconsistently; not recommended or supported |
| Android                     | Not supported                                         |
| iOS                         | Not supported                                         |
| Switch / Xbox / PlayStation | Not supported                                         |

The Platform Spoof option can display Epic, Steam, Mac, Microsoft, Itch, iOS, Android, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation, or Starlight to other clients. These are spoofing targets, not platforms on which the mod itself can run.


### Enable detailed local logs

Open **Menu → Notifications & Logging** and enable **Detailed Unity/RPC Logs**.

This restores verbose RPC, Message, Info, and Debug output. Disable it during normal play for better performance; warnings and errors remain available.

The main local BepInEx log is usually stored at:

```
Among Us/BepInEx/LogOutput.log
```

<summary><strong>Cosmetics and Cosmicube unlocks</strong></summary>

* **Unlock All except Cosmicubes** — locally makes regular cosmetics available for selection. It does not grant server-side ownership.
* **Unlock Cosmicubes** — locally exposes Cosmicubes without changing their completion progress or server data.
* **Activate 100% Cosmicubes** — allows a fully completed Cosmicube to be selected locally. No activation data is sent to the server.

These options are located in the **Menu** tab. Unlock behavior is client-side, may reset after updates, and does not create purchases, currency, permanent ownership, or server-side progression.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
> Unlock features modify only the local game interface and purchase checks. Do not treat locally visible items or progress as permanently owned account content.
