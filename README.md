## Release

| Version | Status | Download |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| v1.3.9 | Latest | [Download ElysiumModMenu.dll](https://github.com/meowchelo/ElysiumModMenu/releases/latest) |

## Highlights

- Clean IMGUI menu with custom themes, RGB accent mode, background image support, custom keybinds, and clipboard-friendly text fields.
- Local name spoofing with no RPC broadcast. Supports plain text, rich text, `shimmer:Name`, and quick hex color syntax like `#68B6E7Name`.
- Local fake Friend Code spoofing for your own client UI, with any symbols or text. The local fake FC is restored before network serialization unless real FC spoof is enabled.
- Real Friend Code spoof option for serialized player info, still sanitized to guest-style codes.
- ESP player info line: `Host - Lv:X - Platform spf - FriendCode`. The `spf` marker appears when platform spoofing is active for the local player.
- Menu text fields are clipped so long values do not squeeze or break the menu layout.
- Paste/copy support across menu input fields with `Ctrl+V`, `Shift+Insert`, `Ctrl+C`, and `Ctrl+X`.

- `Ctrl+C`: copy current field text.
- `Ctrl+X`: cut current field text.
- `Backspace`: delete last character.
- `Esc`: stop editing.

Local name examples:

```text
shimmer:Elysium
#68B6E7BlueName
<color=#68B6E7><b>RichName</b></color>
```
